## What is this plugin?
_**ExplosiveSCPs**_ allows for SCPs and other predetermined classes to explode on their death.
You fully decide which classes explode and which do not. You can even use custom roles, which means
that for example if you have Serpents Hand on your server, you can decide that they too will explode.

_**Use at your own risk**_

## Installation
1. [Install Synapse](https://github.com/SynapseSL/Synapse/wiki#hosting-guides)
2. Place the ExplosiveSCPS.dll file that you can download [here](https://github.com/TheVoidNebula/ExplosiveSCPS/releases) in your plugin directory
3. Restart/Start your server.
